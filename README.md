# Repository organization

Your project implementation should follow the organization in this repository.
See readme.md files in each folder.

# Project Implementation

You must use git repository for the work on the project, making frequent enough commits so
that the project group (and course staff) can follow the progress.

The course staff should be able to easily compile the project work using makefile and related
instructions provided in the git repository. The final output should be in the **master branch** of the git repository.

# Source code documentation

It is recommended to use Doxygen to document your source code.
Please go over the _Project Guidelines_ for details.
